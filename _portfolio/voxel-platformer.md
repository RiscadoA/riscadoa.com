I challenged myself to make a simple 3D voxel platformer in a week from
scratch in C++. I reused a small amount of code from my previous voxel
experiments (the meshing algorithm and the Qubicle file parser).
I made all of the assets myself (programmer art (;). The external dependencies
I used were [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew), for loading OpenGL
extensions, [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) for cross-platform windows and
input and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for math.

You can see the source code or download a release in the game's github
[repository](https://github.com/RiscadoA/voxel-platformer).
