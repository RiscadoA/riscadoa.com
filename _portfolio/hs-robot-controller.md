This project was developed in collaboration with other students at
[HackerSchool](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hackerschool). HackerSchool is
a non-profit academic association where you can find other people with similar
interests to yours and develop projects in many areas. The goal of this project
was to build a 6-wheeled robot with a robotic arm from the ground up.

My task was to write a controller for the robot we're developing. The
controller ran on a Raspberry Pi, and was written in C++.

You can see the source code in the controller's github
[repository](https://github.com/HackerSchool/HS-Robot-Controller).
