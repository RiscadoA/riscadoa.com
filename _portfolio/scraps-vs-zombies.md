[Scraps vs Zombies](https://riscadoa.itch.io/scraps-vs-zombies) was my team's submission
for the Coffee N' Jam 2024, hosted by GameDev Técnico. The game was made with [Cubos]({% link _portfolio/cubos.md %}), a game engine made from scratch by a team which I then led. It was the first time a game was developed for a jam with Cubos. You can read more about it on the [blog post](https://cubosengine.org/blog/coffee-n-jam-2024/) published on the **Cubos** blog.

Team:
- João Manita     (Programmer)
- Ricardo Antunes (Main Programmer & 3D Modeling)
