[EDUCE](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/educe-1) was my team's submission
for the Global Game Jam 2021. It was the first game jam for all of the team
members.
EDUCE is a 3D pixel art exploration and typing shoot-em-up game where the
protagonist returns to his old home one last time to recover his long lost
childhood memories. EDUCE was developed using Godot, Blender, Aseprite and
Bitwig Studio.

Team:
- Lu√≠s Fonseca    (Programmer & Writer)
- Martim Moniz    (Sprite Artist)
- Mateus Pinho    (Sound and Music Composer)
- Ricardo Antunes (Main Programmer & 3D Modeling)
