[Cubos](https://cubosengine.org/) aims to be a simple, but powerful game engine for PC, where everything is made out of voxels. It is [open source](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos) and free to use for any purpose. Written in modern C++ (20) and with data-oriented design in mind, its goal is to be both performant and highly flexible.

It is developed by a team at [GameDev Técnico](www.instagram.com/gamedevtecnico/), a student group at [Instituto Superior Técnico](tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) who make games. The goal of the project is to build a game engine from the ground up and have fun doing it.

I was one of the founding members of **Cubos**, and was the team's leader for 4 years. During these 4 years, the project grew from a small bundle of tools to an actual game engine, with in-house rendering, physics, audio, and much more. As project leader, I managed a team of +15 students, helping set a course for the project and managing releases, enforcing good programming conventions and Git usage, frequently onboarding new members, and personally working and designing many of the engine's features and architecture.
