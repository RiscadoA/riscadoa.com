[Roll Racers](https://riscadoa.itch.io/ondisseia) was my team's submission
for the Coffee N' Jam 2025. The game was made with [Cubos]({% link _portfolio/cubos.md %}), a game engine made from scratch by a team which I then led. This was the first game made using the physics capabilities developed on **Cubos** by our team. You can read more about it on the [blog post](https://cubosengine.org/blog/roll-racers/) published on the **Cubos** blog.
