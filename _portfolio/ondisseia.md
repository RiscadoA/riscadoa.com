[Ondisseia](https://riscadoa.itch.io/ondisseia) was my team's submission
for the Azul Jam 2025. The game was made with [Cubos]({% link _portfolio/cubos.md %}), a game engine made from scratch by a team which I then led. You can read more about it on the [blog post](https://cubosengine.org/blog/the-ondisseia-of-cubos/) published on the **Cubos** blog.
