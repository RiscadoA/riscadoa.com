In the last months I haven't worked on any personal project due to me getting a
part-time job in software engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, where I'm
working as a full stack developer. I've also been selected to participate in
Google Summer of Code and contribute to the OpenCV project.

My contribution to OpenCV will be laying the ground work for a 3D visualization
API, using OpenGL and GLFW to show 3D meshes, point clouds and other data sets,
seamlessly integrated with the already existing API. Here is the
[link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6722744298766336)
to my project.

Still, even with these two projects on hands, now that the exam period is over,
I plan to continue my personal projects.
