This year I have participated in a game jam for the first time (Global Game Jam
2021). My team's submission was [EDUCE](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/educe-1),
a game where the protagonist returns to his old home one last time to recover
his long lost childhood memories. EDUCE was developed using Godot, Blender,
Aseprite and Bitwig Studio. It is a 3D pixel art exploration and typing
shoot-em-up game.

Team:
- Lu√≠s Fonseca    (Programmer & Writer)
- Martim Moniz    (Sprite Artist)
- Mateus Pinho    (Sound and Music Composer)
- Ricardo Antunes (Main Programmer & 3D Modeling)
