I'm Ricardo Antunes, currently a second year student of Computer Science and
Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal. Programming has
been an interest of mine for quite a lot of time (~8 years), being one of my
main hobbies. I love learning new stuff and there are few areas of knowledge
that I have no interest in.

My main area of interest right now in software development is game development.
I have been working on and off on some personal basic game engines for some
years now, which have given me a lot of experience with OpenGL, C and C++.
 
I also participate in some competitive programming contests, and I have been
selected to represent Portugal in the International Olympiads of
Informatics twice (2019 and 2020).

I've also recently gained interest on Game Jams and I'm planning to continue to
take part on many of them.
