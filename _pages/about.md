I'm a second year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto
Superior Técnico, Lisbon, Portugal.Programming has been one of my main hobbies
since I was 10 years old. I love learning new stuff and there are only few
areas of knowledge that I have no interest in.

The programming languages I have the most expertise in are C and C++, since
they were the first I learned and the ones I used the most. I also have some
experience in Rust, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Python, Java, C# and Prolog.

One of my main interests is game development, or more precisely, game engine
development: I've worked on multiple personal game engine projects over the
years, which has given me a lot of experience with OpenGL, DirectX and some
Vulkan experience too.

I'm a member of [HackerSchool](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hackerschool) and
[Game Dev Técnico](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gamedevtecnico/). I'm also
currently working as a full-stack developer intern at
[IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt).

At HackerSchool I'm developing a robot with my team, and I've been assigned the
task of designing and writing the
[robot controller]({% post_url 2021-10-23-hs-robot-controller-1 %}).

At Game Dev Técnico I'm designing and coding
[CUBOS.](https://github.com/GameDevTecnico/cubos), a new game engine made from
scratch in C++.
 
I also participate in some competitive programming contests, and I have been
selected to represent Portugal in the International Olympiads of
Informatics twice (2019 and 2020).

~~I use Arch btw~~ (not anymore). I'm using NixOS as my daily driver right now,
you can see my config [here](https://github.com/RiscadoA/nixconfig).
