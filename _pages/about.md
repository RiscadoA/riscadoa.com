Programming and engineering in general has been a big part of my life since I was a kid.
I love learning new stuff and there are few areas of knowledge that I have no interest in.

Over the years my interests have ranged from making games, developing my own game engines, and even designing CPUs from scratch and writing toy programming languages. Through these journeys I learned a lot about a multitude of areas of software engineering, from networking and graphics programming to physics simulation and theoretical computer science.

I am currently completing my Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisbon, Portugal. I used my time at university to deepen and consolidate my knowledge, and decided to focus on distributed systems and cybersecurity. Additionally, I spent an Erasmus semester at Chalmers Institute of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, where I took multiple formal verification courses. On my free time I both worked on personal projects and in multiple non-profit student-led projects, from [robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hackerschool) to [game development](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gamedevtecnico). Namely, I led a team of +15 students for 4 years to develop the [Cubos Engine](https://cubosengine.org/) from scratch, a cross-platform data-oriented voxel-based game engine written in C++.

Through all these projects I gained a deep expertise in C and C++, which were my first programming languages. On the way, I've become fluent in many more languages, such as Rust (now my favorite language), JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Coq, Agda, and many others. I've also gained a lot of knowledge on GPU programming through APIs such as modern OpenGL, DirectX and Vulkan.

Professionally, I've interned two summers at [SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/), a company developing a distributed database, where I contributed to a large professional C++ codebase for the first time. I have also worked as both a full-stack developer and operating systems teaching assistant at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt). 

In my high-school years and early university I participated in multiple competitive programming contests. I was selected to represent Portugal in the International Olympiads of Informatics (IOI) twice, in 2019 and 2020.  

~~I use Arch btw~~ (not anymore). I'm using NixOS as my daily driver right now,
